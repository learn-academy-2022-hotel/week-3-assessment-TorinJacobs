# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX stands for JavaScript XML and is the markup language used in React to create HTML functionality in a JavaScript like environment. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is the ability to use React fragments which provide the ability to contain multiple lines of code functionality.

Researched answer: JSX is syntactic sugar for React, which means it provides additional functionality/efficiency to build web pages than either JavaScript or HTML alone can do. It provides the functionality to produce HTML within JavaScript.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a JavaScript library to test code. When running yarn the node module is modified.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager developed by Facebook (now Meta) that installs and manages dependencies and provides terminal command functionality for testing. A directory is created called node_modules, when 'yarn add jest' is run that installs the dependencies managed by yarn.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A component is a function in a React app. It provides data and action functionality.

Researched answer: Everything in React is a component (I was going to say this and should have gone with my gut): an independent and reusable bit of code. Components provide JavaScript functionality to be rendered on a browser.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values provide an intitial and default value that can be updated to a new state value on a webpage. Props are components that store the data/action to execute on a webpage.

Researched answer: State value and props are similar in that they're both objects. However, using JavaScript as an analogy: props are like function parameters in that they get passed to a component, whereas state is like a variable declaration within a function such that it is managed within the component.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model and provides the user interface experience on a browser by utilizing monitoring events like clicking on a menu item, or hovering above a photo with the mouse pointer.

Researched answer: DOM is the visual representation of webpages. It is the structure that contains every element and corresponding properties of a website as nodes.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div refers to a subset or section of a website and a span refers to a larger network of pages for a website.

Researched answer (from hubspot): Div and span are both HTML elements that group related parts of a webpage together. Specifically, a div (division) element divides page content into blocks that starts a new line with a width of the whole page or parent container. A span element works at the line level, or inline. It doesn't start a new line and only affects the amount of space on the page as its content.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: You down with OOP? Yeah you know me! A programming manner that foregoes large continuous code with numerous dependencies in favor of smaller objects/containers of code that can interact together independently preventing whole system collapse.

2. Ruby: An OOP language developed by Yukihiro Matusmoto, affectionately known as Matz. MINASWAN!

3. Implicit return: Rather than having to type 'return' in a method, the 'return' is implied meaning that it's already expected to return a condition, so the word can be omitted in the code.

4. Ruby blocks: An anonymous function passed to a method to determine the outcome defined by the words 'do' and 'end'.

5. Ruby hashes: a collection of unique keys and their values whereby the values are referenced by their unique key, unlike an array that's referenced by it's index. Hashes enumerable, therefore can use iterable methods.
